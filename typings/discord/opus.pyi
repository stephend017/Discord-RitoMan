def libopus_loader(name): # -> CDLL:

def load_opus(name): # -> None:
    """Loads the libopus shared library for use with voice.

    If this function is not called then the library uses the function
    :func:`ctypes.util.find_library` and then loads that one if available.

    Not loading a library and attempting to use PCM based AudioSources will
    lead to voice not working.

    This function propagates the exceptions thrown.

    .. warning::

        The bitness of the library must match the bitness of your python
        interpreter. If the library is 64-bit then your python interpreter
        must be 64-bit as well. Usually if there's a mismatch in bitness then
        the load will throw an exception.

    .. note::

        On Windows, this function should not need to be called as the binaries
        are automatically loaded.

    .. note::

        On Windows, the .dll extension is not necessary. However, on Linux
        the full extension is required to load the library, e.g. ``libopus.so.1``.
        On Linux however, :func:`ctypes.util.find_library` will usually find the library automatically
        without you having to call this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: :class:`str`
        The filename of the shared library.
