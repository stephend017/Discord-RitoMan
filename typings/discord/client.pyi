class Client:
    r"""Represents a client connection that connects to Discord.
    This class is used to interact with the Discord WebSocket and API.

    A number of options can be passed to the :class:`Client`.

    Parameters
    -----------
    max_messages: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The maximum number of messages to store in the internal message cache.
        This defaults to ``1000``. Passing in ``None`` disables the message cache.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.3
            Allow disabling the message cache and change the default size to ``1000``.
    loop: Optional[:class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`]
        The :class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` to use for asynchronous operations.
        Defaults to ``None``, in which case the default event loop is used via
        :func:`asyncio.get_event_loop()`.
    connector: :class:`aiohttp.BaseConnector`
        The connector to use for connection pooling.
    proxy: Optional[:class:`str`]
        Proxy URL.
    proxy_auth: Optional[:class:`aiohttp.BasicAuth`]
        An object that represents proxy HTTP Basic Authorization.
    shard_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        Integer starting at ``0`` and less than :attr:`.shard_count`.
    shard_count: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The total number of shards.
    intents: :class:`Intents`
        The intents that you want to enable for the session. This is a way of
        disabling and enabling certain gateway events from triggering and being sent.
        If not given, defaults to a regularly constructed :class:`Intents` class.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    member_cache_flags: :class:`MemberCacheFlags`
        Allows for finer control over how the library caches members.
        If not given, defaults to cache as much as possible with the
        currently selected intents.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    fetch_offline_members: :class:`bool`
        A deprecated alias of ``chunk_guilds_at_startup``.
    chunk_guilds_at_startup: :class:`bool`
        Indicates if :func:`.on_ready` should be delayed to chunk all guilds
        at start-up if necessary. This operation is incredibly slow for large
        amounts of guilds. The default is ``True`` if :attr:`Intents.members`
        is ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    status: Optional[:class:`.Status`]
        A status to start your presence with upon logging on to Discord.
    activity: Optional[:class:`.BaseActivity`]
        An activity to start your presence with upon logging on to Discord.
    allowed_mentions: Optional[:class:`AllowedMentions`]
        Control how the client handles mentions by default on every message sent.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4
    heartbeat_timeout: :class:`float`
        The maximum numbers of seconds before timing out and restarting the
        WebSocket in the case of not receiving a HEARTBEAT_ACK. Useful if
        processing the initial packets take too long to the point of disconnecting
        you. The default timeout is 60 seconds.
    guild_ready_timeout: :class:`float`
        The maximum number of seconds to wait for the GUILD_CREATE stream to end before
        preparing the member cache and firing READY. The default timeout is 2 seconds.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4
    guild_subscriptions: :class:`bool`
        Whether to dispatch presence or typing events. Defaults to ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

        .. warning::

            If this is set to ``False`` then the following features will be disabled:

                - No user related updates (:func:`on_user_update` will not dispatch)
                - All member related events will be disabled.
                    - :func:`on_member_update`
                    - :func:`on_member_join`
                    - :func:`on_member_remove`

                - Typing events will be disabled (:func:`on_typing`).
                - If ``fetch_offline_members`` is set to ``False`` then the user cache will not exist.
                  This makes it difficult or impossible to do many things, for example:

                    - Computing permissions
                    - Querying members in a voice channel via :attr:`VoiceChannel.members` will be empty.
                    - Most forms of receiving :class:`Member` will be
                      receiving :class:`User` instead, except for message events.
                    - :attr:`Guild.owner` will usually resolve to ``None``.
                    - :meth:`Guild.get_member` will usually be unavailable.
                    - Anything that involves using :class:`Member`.
                    - :attr:`users` will not be as populated.
                    - etc.

            In short, this makes it so the only member you can reliably query is the
            message author. Useful for bots that do not require any state.
    assume_unsync_clock: :class:`bool`
        Whether to assume the system clock is unsynced. This applies to the ratelimit handling
        code. If this is set to ``True``, the default, then the library uses the time to reset
        a rate limit bucket given by Discord. If this is ``False`` then your system clock is
        used to calculate how long to sleep for. If this is set to ``False`` it is recommended to
        sync your system clock to Google's NTP server.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3
