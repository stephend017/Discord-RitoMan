class _Semaphore:
    """This class is a version of a semaphore.

    If you're wondering why asyncio.Semaphore isn't being used,
    it's because it doesn't expose the internal value. This internal
    value is necessary because I need to support both `wait=True` and
    `wait=False`.

    An asyncio.Queue could have been used to do this as well -- but it is
    not as inefficient since internally that uses two queues and is a bit
    overkill for what is basically a counter.
