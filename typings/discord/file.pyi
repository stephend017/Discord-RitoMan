    Attributes
    -----------
    fp: Union[:class:`str`, :class:`io.BufferedIOBase`]
        A file-like object opened in binary mode and read mode
        or a filename representing a file in the hard drive to
        open.

        .. note::

            If the file-like object passed is opened via ``open`` then the
            modes 'rb' should be used.

            To pass binary data, consider usage of ``io.BytesIO``.

    filename: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The filename to display when uploading to Discord.
        If this is not given then it defaults to ``fp.name`` or if ``fp`` is
        a string then the ``filename`` will default to the string given.
    spoiler: :class:`bool`
        Whether the attachment is a spoiler.
