    Attributes
    -----------
    DISPATCH
        Receive only. Denotes an event to be sent to Discord, such as READY.
    HEARTBEAT
        When received tells Discord to keep the connection alive.
        When sent asks if your connection is currently alive.
    IDENTIFY
        Send only. Starts a new session.
    PRESENCE
        Send only. Updates your presence.
    VOICE_STATE
        Send only. Starts a new connection to a voice guild.
    VOICE_PING
        Send only. Checks ping time to a voice guild, do not use.
    RESUME
        Send only. Resumes an existing connection.
    RECONNECT
        Receive only. Tells the client to reconnect to a new gateway.
    REQUEST_MEMBERS
        Send only. Asks for the full member list of a guild.
    INVALIDATE_SESSION
        Receive only. Tells the client to optionally invalidate the session
        and IDENTIFY again.
    HELLO
        Receive only. Tells the client the heartbeat interval.
    HEARTBEAT_ACK
        Receive only. Confirms receiving of a heartbeat. Not having it implies
        a connection issue.
    GUILD_SYNC
        Send only. Requests a guild sync.
    gateway
        The gateway we are currently connected to.
    token
        The authentication token for discord.
