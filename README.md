# discord_ritoman :trollface:
This is a project designed to improve mine and my discord friends League of Legends experience by providing valuable insights into our gameplay performances while also doubling as a feature project I can display on my resume. This full stack application includes a variety of different features including data management, using 3rd party API's, CI / CD, robust and automated testing, and thorough documentation.
